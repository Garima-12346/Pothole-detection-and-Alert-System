# Pothole-detection-and-Alert-System
The Pothole Detection and Alert System Project is an innovative technological solution aimed at enhancing road safety and maintenance. It involves the development and implementation of sensors and software algorithms that can identify and detect potholes on roads. These sensors, often integrated into vehicles or installed along roadways, gather data about road conditions and irregularities. The software algorithms then analyze this data to accurately pinpoint the presence of potholes.
Our proposed system is based on Arduino and consist of ultrasonic sensor which detects the
pothole as these use sound waves so if distance is greater than the distance from the sensor to
road then it triggers and gives indication about the pothole and its depth, the GPS module
connected in the system gives the location (longitude and latitude), the WI-FI module Node
MCU 8266 is connected to the internet through Wi-Fi now all this detail will be sent from the
Node MCU to the cloud that is google firebase which then organize the data and send this to
the municipal authority its easy and efficient as well from the existing system. 
Here is the Overview of Our Project:
