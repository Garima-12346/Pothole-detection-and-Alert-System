# Pothole-detection-and-Alert-System
Our proposed system is based on Arduino and consist of ultrasonic sensor which detects the
pothole as these use sound waves so if distance is greater than the distance from the sensor to
road then it triggers and gives indication about the pothole and its depth, the GPS module
connected in the system gives the location (longitude and latitude), the WI-FI module Node
MCU 8266 is connected to the internet through Wi-Fi now all this detail will be sent from the
Node MCU to the cloud that is google firebase which then organize the data and send this to
the municipal authority its easy and efficient as well from the existing system.
